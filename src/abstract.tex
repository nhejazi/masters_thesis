  Exploratory analysis of high-dimensional biological sequencing data has
received much attention largely because high-throughput biotechnology allows
simultaneous screening of numerous biological characteristics. While there has
been an increase in the dimensionality of such data sets in studies of
environmental exposure and biomarkers, two important questions have received
less interest than deserved: 1) how to derive estimation of independent
associations in the context of many competing causes, while avoiding model
misspecification; and 2) how to derive accurate small-sample inference when
data-adaptive techniques are employed in this context. The central focus of
this paper is on variable importance analysis in high-dimensional biological
data sets with modest sample sizes, using semiparametric statistical models.
We present a method that is reasonably robust in small samples, but does not
rely on arbitrary parametric assumptions, in the context of studies of gene
expression and environmental exposures. Such analyses are faced with not only
multiple testing issues, but also the problems of trying to tease out the
associations of biological expression measures with exposure, among confounds
such as age, race, and smoking, among others. Specifically, we propose the use
of targeted minimum loss-based estimation (TMLE), along with a generalization
of the moderated t-statistic, relying on the influence curve representation of
a statistical target parameter, to obtain estimates of variable importance
measures (VIM). The result is a data-adaptive approach that can estimate
independent associations in high-dimensional data, even in the presence of
relatively small samples.
