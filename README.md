## Summary

This thesis presents a generalized method for using Targeted Minimum Loss-Based
Estimation (TMLE) to...

## Contents

* Chapter 1: Causal inference in high-dimensional biology

* Chapter 2: The local average treatment effect parameter

* Chapter 3: Applications to the study of DNA methylation

* Chapter 4: Software module - R package "methadapt"

---

## Related

* [`methadapt`](https://github.com/nhejazi/methadapt/tree/master) - R package
    implementing an algorithm to data-adaptively identify and estimate local
    average treatment effects, specifically designed to provide inference
    on CpG sites using data produced by standard DNA methylation assays.

## Compilation

* `make all` - compile the thesis document, generating two subdirectories: `pdf`
    (containing the thesis and approval page in PDF) and `output` (containing
    auxiliary documents created in the compilation process).

* `make clean` - removes the subdirectories generated by the use of `make all`.

_N.B._, a functional installation of a LaTeX distribution (_e.g._,
[MacTeX](http://www.tug.org/mactex/)) is required to compile this thesis
document.
