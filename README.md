## Summary

This thesis presents a generalized approach for employing empirical Bayes
moderation to improve the stability of estimates of variable importance measures
(VIMs) using Targeted Minimum Loss-Based Estimation (TMLE), primarily in the
context of problems often encountered in high-dimensional biology.

* __The compiled thesis document (in PDF) is available for browsing
[here](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~nhejazi/publications/thesis-ma-biostat.pdf).__

* *This master's thesis has officially been accepted by the Graduate Division of
UC Berkeley, with an effective filing date of 22 March 2017.*

### Related

* [`biotmle`](http://nimahejazi.org/biotmle/) - R package that facilitates
  biomarker discovery by generalizing the moderated t-statistic of Smyth for use
  with asymptotically linear target parameters using Targeted Minimum Loss-Based
  Estimation.

### Compilation

* `make all` - compile the thesis document, generating two subdirectories: `pdf`
    (containing the thesis and approval page in PDF) and `output` (containing
    auxiliary documents created in the compilation process).

* `make clean` - removes the subdirectories generated by the use of `make all`.

* _n.b._, a functional installation of a LaTeX distribution (_e.g._,
    [MacTeX](http://www.tug.org/mactex/)) is required to compile this thesis
    document.
