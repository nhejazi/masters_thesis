  biomarker discovery by generalizing the moderated t-statistic of Smyth for use
  with asymptotically linear target parameters (to assess variable importance)
  by using Targeted Minimum Loss-Based Estimation.

## Compilation

* `make all` - compile the thesis document, generating two subdirectories: `pdf`
    (containing the thesis and approval page in PDF) and `output` (containing
    auxiliary documents created in the compilation process).

* `make clean` - removes the subdirectories generated by the use of `make all`.

_N.B._, a functional installation of a LaTeX distribution (_e.g._,
[MacTeX](http://www.tug.org/mactex/)) is required to compile this thesis
document.
